Hello! My name is Shelby De Oliveira Cignetti. I am a student at Georgia Tech Bootcamp for Coding. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Fine Arts. I have a cat name Mimikyu and she was a stray. I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where I lived in Latrobe, Pennsylvania until 2002. Then I moved to the Golden Isles in Southeast Georgia. Then in 2010, I moved to Atlanta for college. I am AWS certified and plan on getting more certifications later. In my free time, I like to play videogames, hike, rock climbing, and volunteer at Dragoncon and Momocon.
